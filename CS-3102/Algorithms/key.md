## DFS
- can use call stack (recursion) instead of explicit stack (iterative)
- LIFO
- explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking
- applications: pathfinding, cycle detection, topological sorting.
- time complexity: O(V + E)

## BFS
- queue
- FIFO
- explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper.
- applications: shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal
- time complexity: O(V + E)
