- **Purpose**:
  - **Warshall's Algorithm**: Computes the transitive closure of a graph, determining whether there is a path between each pair of vertices.
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

- **Graph Representation**:
  - Both algorithms use an **adjacency matrix**. In Warshall's, matrix values are either `1` (path exists) or `INF` (no direct path). In Floyd-Warshall, values represent the shortest path distance (or `INF` for no path).

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Warshall**: **O(V^3)**, iterating through all pairs of vertices and checking for reachable paths.
  - **Floyd-Warshall**: **O(V^3)**, also iterating through all pairs of vertices but updating path lengths instead of just checking reachability.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Both algorithms use **O(V^2)** space to store the adjacency matrix or path matrix.

- **Process**:
  - **Warshall's Algorithm**: Iteratively updates the matrix to reflect whether a path exists between any two vertices.
    1. Initialize a reachability matrix (adjacency matrix).
    2. For each vertex `k`, update the matrix to check for paths from `i` to `j` through `k`.
  
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Iteratively computes the shortest path for each pair of vertices.
    1. Initialize a distance matrix (adjacency matrix with edge weights).
    2. For each vertex `k`, update the matrix to check if a shorter path exists from `i` to `j` through `k`.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Warshall's Algorithm**:
    - Focuses on reachability (path existence).
    - Uses a simple matrix update to determine if two vertices are connected through an intermediary vertex.
    
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
    - Focuses on finding the shortest paths, considering edge weights.
    - Updates the matrix to ensure that for each vertex pair `(i, j)`, the shortest distance is considered, including through intermediate vertices.
    - Can be used for negative weights (but not negative weight cycles).
    
  - **Differences**:
    - **Warshall**: Tracks connectivity (reachable paths).
    - **Floyd-Warshall**: Tracks path lengths and can handle edge weights, allowing for shortest path calculations.
