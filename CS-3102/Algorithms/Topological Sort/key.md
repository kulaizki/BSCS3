- **Purpose**: Finds a linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where for every directed edge **uv**, vertex **u** comes before **v** in the ordering.

- **Approach**:
  1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Uses DFS traversal to visit all vertices.
  2. **Post-order Processing**: Vertices are pushed onto a stack after all their adjacent vertices are visited, ensuring correct ordering.

- **Graph Representation**: Uses **adjacency list** where each vertex points to its neighbors.

- **Time Complexity**: **O(V + E)**, where **V** is vertices and **E** is edges, as each vertex and edge is visited once during DFS.

- **Space Complexity**: **O(V + E)** for adjacency list and visited array.

- **Visited Array**: Tracks visited nodes to prevent re-processing.

- **Process**:
  1. Initialize the graph and set all vertices as unvisited.
  2. Perform DFS from each unvisited vertex, exploring all adjacent vertices recursively.
  3. Push each vertex onto a stack after visiting its neighbors.
  4. After the DFS completes, pop vertices from the stack to get the topological order.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Acyclic**: Topological sorting only works for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
  - **DFS**: The DFS traversal ensures vertices are processed in reverse post-order.
  - **Stack**: Vertices are pushed onto a stack during DFS, and then popped to get the correct topological order.
  - **Dependency Resolution**: Used in scenarios like task scheduling or resolving package dependencies, where tasks must be completed before others.
