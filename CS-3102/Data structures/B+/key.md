- **Structure**:
  - **Internal nodes**: Store only keys (no data).
  - **Leaf nodes**: Store actual data or references to data and are linked for efficient range queries.
  - **Balanced tree**: All leaf nodes are at the same depth, ensuring O(log n) search and insertion times.

- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**:
    - If a node is full, it splits, and the middle key is promoted to the parent node.
    - The root splits if necessary, increasing the tree's height.
    - Insertion is handled recursively, first by finding the correct leaf, and then ensuring splits occur when needed.
  - **Search**:
    - Search is performed by traversing internal nodes to the correct leaf node.
    - The search operation is O(log n), similar to B-trees, but with the added benefit of linked leaves for range queries.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Efficient Range Queries**: Leaf nodes are linked, making range queries faster by sequentially following leaf pointers.
  - **Non-leaf nodes** store only keys for navigation, unlike **B-trees**, where both keys and data reside in internal nodes.
  
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Insertion, Search, and Deletion**: O(log n) for all operations due to balanced structure.
  
- **Differences from Other Trees**:
  - **B-tree vs B+ Tree**: B+ Tree stores only keys in internal nodes, whereas B-trees store both keys and data in internal nodes.
  - **B+ Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)**: B+ Trees are more efficient for disk-based storage and large datasets due to their balanced structure and ability to handle range queries.
  - **B+ Tree vs AVL/Red-Black Trees**: AVL/Red-Black trees are binary trees with height balancing through rotations, while B+ Trees handle multiple keys per node and are more suited for large, disk-based data storage with efficient range queries.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of keys.
