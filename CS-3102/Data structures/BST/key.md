- **Structure**:
  - A **binary tree** where each node has at most two children.
  - **Left child**: Stores keys less than the node's key.
  - **Right child**: Stores keys greater than the node's key.
  - Efficient for search operations due to its ordered structure.

- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**:
    - Traverse the tree to find the correct position for the new key.
    - Insert the key as a leaf node in the correct location.
  - **Search**:
    - Traverse the tree by comparing the key with the current node and move left or right accordingly.
    - Time complexity is O(log n) for balanced trees but O(n) in the worst case.
  - **Deletion**:
    - Find the node to delete, considering three cases:
      - Node has no children (leaf node).
      - Node has one child.
      - Node has two children (find the inorder successor or predecessor).
    - After deletion, the tree is rearranged to maintain its BST property.
  - **In-order Traversal**:
    - Traverse the left subtree, visit the node, then traverse the right subtree.
    - Results in sorted order for a BST.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Insertion**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced tree).
  - **Search**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case.
  - **Deletion**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node is stored individually in memory.

- **Differences from Other Trees**:
  - **BST vs AVL/Red-Black Tree**: 
    - BST can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance (O(n) time for operations). AVL/Red-Black trees are self-balancing, ensuring O(log n) time for all operations.
  - **BST vs B-tree/B+ Tree**: 
    - BST is typically used in memory, while B-trees/B+ trees are used in disk-based storage due to their ability to handle multiple keys per node and minimize disk I/O.
  - **BST vs Skip List**: 
    - Skip lists provide probabilistic balancing, unlike BSTs that rely on key ordering for performance.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Ordered** structure allows for efficient searching.
  - **Recursive nature** simplifies insertion and deletion algorithms.
  - Performance can degrade if the tree becomes unbalanced, hence self-balancing trees like AVL/Red-Black trees are often preferred.
