- operations mostly use next node's key (look ahead)
- levels are assigned randomly to balance performance
- update array tracks predecessors at each level during operations
- forward pointers in each node enable fast traversal
- head node spans all levels for efficient access
- insertion adjusts forward pointers to maintain order
- deletion removes forward pointers and bypasses the target node
- search efficiency is 𝑂(logn) due to skipping levels
- random height ensures probabilistic balancing similar to binary trees
- ideal for dynamic ordered data with frequent updates
